# Individual Project
This repository is used for my college first year project.
The dataset here is from https://www.kaggle.com/vikasukani/diabetes-data-set.
And the code here shows my work about modeling, testing and output.
The modeling part includes 5 methods (LDA, QDA, LR, SVM and k-NN).
The testing part includes percentage split (75:25) and cross validation procedure.
The output part includes results of testing part as datasets and several graphs for the poster.
